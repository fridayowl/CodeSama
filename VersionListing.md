Version 2 Implementing ide: 
        single file 
        python ide for editing the file 
        class and function flow 

Version 2.1  Controlling flows from  ide :

        add's
        Bugs to fix : 
            -Fix standalone functions not connecting with ide

working 2.6 - Closing functions for single file 
        Single file 
        - Idenfy the standalone code inside a class 
            @done
        - Identify the standalone code and functions seperatly  @done
        - Fix the connectors not moving as desired  @done
        - Set the zoom level to 70% 
        -Fix setting unique id for the blocks rather than the function name or code name



Version 2.7 - Setting Connectors exact line of the ide  and also make this blocks smaller and compact
